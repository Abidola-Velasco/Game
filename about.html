        <h1>About Me Page</h1>
        <h2>About me<h2>
        <p>
            Hi, my name is Abi Velasco, I am a freshman and attend ESUMS in New Haven. I like to spend time with my family and friends and I like to play soccer. I also like to play video games, swimming, going on bike rides, and create new things out of legos.
        </p>
        <h2>Defenition of a Game</h2>
        <p>
            My defenition of a game is as follows: A game is something that one or more people can play wth some sort of objective and requires a bit of skill.
        </p>
        <h2>My gamer types</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>My main gamer type is Achiever at 60%. It makes sense because I like to complete all the achievements, acomplish every quest, and collect all the gear.</li>
            <li>My second gamer type is Killer at 53%. I was surprised because I usually keep to myself in online games. But then again, I do like to ruin someone else's game.(Not very fond of this when it happens to me)</li>
            <li>My third gamer type is Socializer at 47%. I expected this here as I like to play with my friends that I know I can rely on. But with randoms they are unreliable and don't communicate.</li>
            <li>My final gamer type is Explorer at 40%. I expected this to be my second highest since I like to explore the open world in games and explore new things.
        </ul>
            <h2>My favorite games</h2>
            <li>Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild: I really love this game and how much detail went into making it. The story is very good and the gameply is amazing with so much to do and so many secrets to uncover. It is my favorite game of all time.</li>
            <li>Soccer: I love to play soccer with my team and friends, running around, doing skills, and playing as a team is why I love it so much.
            <li>Rocket League: Take soccer and add soem cars into the mix, this game is very fun and entertaining to play with friends.
