        <h2>About me<h2>
        <p>
            Hey, my name is Abi Velasco, I am a freshman and attend ESUMS in New Haven. I like to spend time with my family and friends and I like to play soccer. I also like to play video games, swimming, going on bike rides, and create new things out of legos.
        </p>
        <h2>Defenition of a Game</h2>
        <p>
            My defenition of a game is as follows: A game is something that one or more people can play wth some sort of objective and requires a bit of skill.
        </p>
        <h2>My gamer types</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>My main gamer type is Achiever at 60%. It makes sense because I like to complete all the achievements, acomplish every quest, and collect all the gear.</li>
            <li>My second gamer type is Killer at 53%. I was surprised because I usually keep to myself in online games. But then again, I do like to ruin someone else's game.(Not very fond of this when it happens to me)</li>
